//! This crate provides essential primitives for proving transaction inclusion in the Strata bridge.
//! It is a temporary separation from `strata-bridge-primitives` due to its dependency on `bitvm`,
//! which in turn depends on `tokio`, making it incompatible with compilation inside the ZKVM.
//!
//! **TODO:** Move this functionality back into `strata-bridge-primitives` once the dependency on
//! `tokio` inside `bitvm` is resolved.
